# USStock-Momentum-PE-Sorter
This is a momentum based pe sorting bot which focuses on companies with a high implied momentum (an average over a number of time periods) and a low p/e Ratio to display a list of 15 companies. This was made as a 'fun' project and should not be used in a professional setting without modification.  

-Issues for consideration 
- this does not remove outliers from the pool, new/hype stocks with large growth rates over 1 year may be unfairly weighted. 
- Pe ratios are useful only if companies satisfy certain criterion, such a filter is not used in this code, and should be added for higher accuracy.
